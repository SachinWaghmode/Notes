 16 . Are all Stringâ€™s immutable? 
 17 . Where are String values stored in memory? 
 
 The string is Immutable in Java because String objects are cached in String pool. 
 Since cached String literals are shared between multiple clients there is always a risk,
 where one client's action would affect all another client.
 
 18 . Why should you be careful about String concatenation(+) operator in loops? 
 19 . How do you solve above problem? 
 
 20 . What are differences between String and StringBuffer? 
 21 . What are differences between StringBuilder and StringBuffer?
 
 StringBuffer and StringBuilder have the same methods with one difference and that's of synchronization. 
 StringBuffer is synchronized( which means it is thread safe and hence you can use it when you implement threads for 
 your methods) 
 whereas StringBuilder is not synchronized( which implies it isn't thread safe).
